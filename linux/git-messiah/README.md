# The Ultimate Git Messiah

Welcome to **The Ultimate Git Messiah** repository, where all your lazy developer dreams come true. Gone are the days of tedious git repository initialization and mundane setup tasks. I, the promised savior of the lazy developer, have graced you with a script to handle it all for you.

## Features

- **Automatic Git Repository Initialization**: Why waste time typing `git init` and `git remote add`? Let the Git Messiah do it for you.
- **Fork Mode**: Because sometimes you just want to copy someone else's work. This script will fork an existing repository to your account.
- **Delete Mode**: Made a mistake? Delete a repository with ease. Just be sure you really mean it.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms**: Whether youâ€™re a fan of GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, this script has got you covered.
- **Credential Handling**: Because remembering your username and token is just too much work.
- **Optional README Creation**: Adds a README.md file because, let's be honest, you probably weren't going to do it yourself.
- **Custom Directory Setup**: Specify where you want your new repository to live, or let the script decide for you. Your call, lazy one.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository** (Or you can just download it, but who does that?):
    ```sh
    cd git-messiah
    ```
2. **Make it executable**
   ```sh
    chmod +x git-messiah.sh
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh
    ./git-messiah.sh
    ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Choose your action (create, fork, delete).
   - Enter the repository name (or don't, and see what happens).
   - Select your platform (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket - because choices are hard).
   - Enter your credentials (or not, if you like watching things fail).
   - If creating or forking, specify the directory where you want the repository to be created (or just accept the default because, you know, effort).

4. **Marvel at Your Laziness**:
   - Sit back and watch as the script does everything for you.
   - Take a sip of coffee, you've earned it.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Obviously.
