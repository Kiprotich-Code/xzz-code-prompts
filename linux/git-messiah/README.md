# The Ultimate Git Messiah

Welcome to **The Ultimate Git Messiah** repository, where all your lazy developer dreams come true. Gone are the days of tedious git repository initialization and mundane setup tasks. I, the promised savior of the lazy developer, have graced you with a script to handle it all for you.

## Features

- **Automatic Git Repository Initialization**: Why waste time typing `git init` and `git remote add`? Let the Git Messiah do it for you.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms**: Whether youâ€™re a fan of GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, this script has got you covered.
- **Credential Handling**: Because remembering your username and token is just too much work.
- **Optional README Creation**: Adds a README.md file because, let's be honest, you probably weren't going to do it yourself.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository** (Or you can just download it, but who does that?):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mwangiiharun/git-messiah.git 
    or
    git clone https://github.com/Nerds-Catapult/xzz-code-prompts.git
    cd git-messiah
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh
    ./init_git_repo.sh
    ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
    - Enter the repository name (or don't, and see what happens).
    - Select your platform (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket - because choices are hard).
    - Enter your credentials (or not, if you like watching things fail).

4. **Marvel at Your Laziness**:
    - Sit back and watch as the script does everything for you.
    - Take a sip of coffee, you've earned it.
